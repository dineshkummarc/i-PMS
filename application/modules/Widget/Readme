i-PMS Widgets component

For a Web site, a widget is described like a small tool that allows developers to add some module to they site without
having to change the base code (ie. the core). A widget can appear in specific area on Web page, like the 'sidebar'
(eg. the right column). It allow to display internal or external information (such as the last comments, the last posts
availables on other site...). A widget can also be interactive. For example, a widget can provide an authentication
process that allows user to authenticate.

i-PMS is a project management system mostly based on widgets. The most elements of the pages shown to the site end user
come from many widgets executed in order defined by the site admin, and finally, rendered in widget areas that are
pre-defined in templates (theme used for final rendering).

The i-PMS Widget component can be seen like a king-of plug-in API, but that was firstly designed to provide a simple way
to arrange the various elements of your site content without having to change any code, and more specially the theme
that you use.

i-PMS comes with a lot of widgets that can be placed where you want* on your site. The widgets can be displayed in many
areas that are pre-defined in theme you use. For example, by using the default i-PMS theme, you can choose between
several areas such as the header, the content, the sidebar, and the footer. Also, each area can have its own sub-zones
described in lowerCamelCaseCSS notation - (e.g topRight, rightBottom, bottomLeft, leftTop) by defaut, all widgets are
shown in normal flow. The purpose of these sub-zones is to allow you to place the widgets exactly were you want on your
site.

Many themes come with a list of widgets to display when the admin has not explicitly defined his own list via the
dashboard.

* Depending of available widget areas that are defined in the theme you use.
