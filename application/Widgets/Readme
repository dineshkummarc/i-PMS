i-PMS Widgets component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The i-PMS Widget component can be view like a plug-in API, but that is firstly designed to provide a simple way to
arrange the various elements of your site content (known as "widgets") without having to change any code, and more
specially the theme that you use.

i-PMS comes with a lot of widgets that can be placed where you want* on your site. The widgets can be displayed in
different zones that are defined in the theme that you use . For example, if you use the default i-PMS theme, you have
the choose between several zones such as the header, the content, the sidebar, and the footer. Also, you must note that
each zones can have they own sub-zones described in CSS notation - (e.g left top, left bottom, right top, right bottom).
These sub-zones allow you to place the widgets exactly were you want on your site.

Some theme defines a default list of widgets to displays when you doesn't setup the widgets to be displayed for a zone.
For example, the i-PMS default theme defines the sidebar zone where a list of  widgets will be defaulted displayed if
you do not setup your own widgets to be displayed in this zone.

* Depending of the available widget zones that are defined in the theme that you use.
